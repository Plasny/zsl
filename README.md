All of my school projects, exercises and homeworks connected to programming in one place.

At the technical school we had many interesting projects, of which I have listed the best ones below:

- NodeJS, Express (backend only)
- NodeJS, React
- just JavaScript or TypeScript (frontend only)
- Angular (frontend only)
- Python, Flask, SQLite, Bootstrap
